# Ak.Framework
This framework contains libraries which can be used to simplify the process of .net development. Right now it consists of the following libraries:
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Ak.Framework.Core</h4>
    This library has some basic functionality which is used further in other libraries. For example it has different extensions for type conversion, linq, basic comparers and enums.
  </li>
</ul>

By the way source comments are in Russian right now. May be later I'll translate them to English.
